Exercise 07:   Full Script. Thumbnails
ConceptIn the profession, the expectations is that you may be creating visual stories from supplied scripts.      This would include drawing characters that aren’t your own, or working from a script. that you did   not write. In this project students will experience working from a full mainstream professional script   to develop visual interpretation in the form. of thumbnails.
INSTRUCTIONS
Students will create thumbnails for 6 consecutive-comic-pages.
•             Download   the   script. Exercise   07   BatmanGK_   15 Script   SEQA100.pdf
•             Read through the script. to breakdown panel layouts on the   script. (for best results)
•             Create digest-size thumbnails for the 6 consecutive-comic-pages out of   the script.	
•             Thumbnails   should   be   done   in   spreads: page   1, pages   23, pages   45, etc.
•             Page orientation should be portrait, vertical   (not landscape, horizontal)
•             Digest   size   (5.5” x 8.5”); Download   template: Thumbnail   Template.pdf
•             Sharpie/felt-tip; Pencil is fine, but should be dark and clear   (Digital   pencils,   optional)
•             Balloon placement should be   clear
•             Number each dialog per page   (each page   starts with balloon #1)
•             Scan and darken for legibility
Things to   Remember:
•             This project showcases your panel   layout
•             Thumbnails are intended to be fast, not detailed
•             Don’t forget the other things learned   in this   class so   far.
•             Clarity of image and action is always important.
•             Remember: give your characters something to do/explain with their hands.
•             This is your interpretation of the script, there is no wrong way, you make the decissions
•             DO NOT look at the original   published   comic. Any   reference   or similarity to   professional   designed panels and images will be an automatic   failing grade for this assignment
